# 🧠 Mental Health Risk Prediction ML Model

## About

This Data Science project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the risk of mental health issues based on various factors. By analyzing datasets containing personal, lifestyle, and demographic information, the model aims to identify individuals at risk, enabling timely intervention and support.

## 🔍 Features

* **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding data distributions and relationships.
* **Model Building**: Implementing machine learning algorithms to predict mental health risks.
* **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/TaniaKhatun18/Mental-Health-Risk-Prediction-ML-Model.git
   cd Mental-Health-Risk-Prediction-ML-Model
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter notebook**:

   ```
   jupyter notebook Mental_Health.ipynb
   ```

   Follow the instructions within the notebook to explore the analysis and models.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset (`mental_health_dataset.csv`) includes records with various features such as:

* `Age`: Age of the individual.
* `Gender`: Gender of the individual.
* `Income`: Monthly income.
* `Family_History`: Family history of mental health issues.
* `Work_Stress`: Level of work-related stress.
* `Social_Support`: Availability of social support.
* `Physical_Health`: Self-rated physical health status.
* `Mental_Health`: Self-rated mental health status.

## 📈 Insights

This project aims to:

* Identify key factors contributing to mental health risks.
* Provide a predictive model for early detection of mental health issues.
* Offer insights for targeted interventions and support strategies.

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

* Implement more advanced machine learning models for improved accuracy.
* Develop a user-friendly web application for real-time risk assessment.
* Integrate additional features such as lifestyle habits and environmental factors.
